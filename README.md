# Coverflex Hiring Boilerplates

Welcome dear candidate!

Here you will find a set of projects to help you test your coding exercise.
If you find any issues, please let use know! 

## Backend Exercise

If you are applying for a Backend position here at Coverflex, we kindly provide you a simple React app for you to test out your service.

Let me follow you through how to set it up:

1. Go ahead and clone this repo.
1. Make sure you have Node installed.
1. Install npm dependencies: ```npm install```
1. Run it in development mode: ```npm start```

Now you should see something at ```http://localhost:3000```

**Additional Requirements:**

In development mode, this react app is expecting the local backend service to expose port ```4000```.
